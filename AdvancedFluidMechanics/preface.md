Preface
=======

This is a handy companion for the course on *advanced fluid mechanics*
as instructed by your’s truly, at Michigan technological university.
This book is the result of my efforts to streamline my personal notes
for this course. In this first version, you may find errors. I would be
grateful if you could report any errors to me so that I may make
appropriate corrections or just castigate you for jumping to
conclusions.

This book may be divided into the following logical partitions:
establishment of mathematical basis of flux, Leibniz theorem, divergence
theorem and basics of tensors; integral forms of conservation equations;
differential forms of conservation equations; solution of Navier-Stokes’
equations for select scenarios along with numerical solutions.

I have made an effort to include the use of Wolfram *Mathematica* to
solve algebraic equations or ordinary or partial differential equation
that arise in the study of fluid mechanics. In later versions of this
book, there will be chapters with significant emphasis on the
intermingling of Wolfram *Mathematica* and fluid dynamics.

This book includes the following mathematical methods: method of
perturbation expansion, method of similarity solutions, method of
traveling wave solutions and Hopf-Cole transformation. These methods are
not limited to being used for fluid mechanics but may be used for
mathematical models of complex systems.

As an instructor who wishes to use this book, it would be useful to
first direct students to the appendix section on set theory.
